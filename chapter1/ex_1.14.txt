Exercise 1.14: Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those using a
while. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?

Response:

There are advantages in using a for loop in that you don't have to have an extra statement
to increment/decrement a counter (if you intend to use that as the breaking conditional)

Advantage to a while loop is that all it cares about is the condition. Don't need a counter nor
decrementer of any kind.
