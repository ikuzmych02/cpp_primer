Exercise 1.17: What happens in the program presented in this section if the input values
are all equal? What if there are no duplicated values?

Response:

Expectation is that the program will only exit when user interacts with Ctrl+D to kill it. However,
the count should be accurate.
If there are no duplicates, should exit with cnt = 1 for the first input.
